# Film-Recommendation-and-IMDb-Prediction-System-For-Netflix-Data-

- The project details are included in the **.ipynb notebook**, with each cell containing a step-by-step explanation. 
- The notebook provides a comprehensive guide to the project, detailing data merging and cleaning, exploratory data analysis, correlation analysis, and the implementation of unsupervised machine learning algorithms such as **Cosine Similarity** and **K-means clustering** for creating a film recommendation system. 
- The notebook also details the implementation of supervised machine learning algorithms such as **KNN**, **Random Forest classification**, and **Linear Regression** for creating an ***IMDb prediction system***. 
- The notebook covers the preprocessing of data by encoding string columns into integer values, which are used in algorithms that require integer features. The ultimate goal of the project is to provide users with accurate recommendations and ratings for movies and TV shows based on the analyzed data.
